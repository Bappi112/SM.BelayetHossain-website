<p>I want to reconnect with the power of natural voice,Authentic</p>
<p>Do you need to reconnect with your voice?
 Everyone has times when they are feeling a bit down with their singing. 
 Maybe even to the point where you’ve stopped singing entirely.
 Sometimes that’s because of external factors (like a pandemic!) out of our control.
 Sometimes it’s directly related to a singing experience,
 perhaps something that resulted in a loss of confidence (like an unsuccessful audition!).
 In the context of the worldwide lockdown, I came up with this guide to help my students 
 reconnect with their voices when they weren’t really feeling like singing.We’ve all been there (me too!) and if this is making you nod, I hope this will help you, too!</p>
